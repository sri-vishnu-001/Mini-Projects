We cleaned up all the data using different techniques such as data imputation,Feature extraction,outlier detection,
feature selection etc.
Later applied all the regression techniques and verified the performance of each algorithm.
Finally our model is stored and deployed to predict fare of Airline ticket based on different routes and Airways brands.
